# Welcome to DOS Comment Map VS Code Extension

## What's in the folder

* This folder contains all of the files necessary for your extension.
* `package.json` - this is the manifest file in which you declare your extension and command.
  * The plugin registers commands and defines its title and command name. With this information VS Code can show the command in the command palette and sidebar.
* `src/extension.ts` - this is the main file where you will provide the implementation of your extension.
  * The file exports one function, `activate`, which is called the very first time your extension is activated. Inside the `activate` function we call `registerCommand` and set up the doc comment outline provider.
  * The extension supports doc comments for multiple languages (JSDoc, Javadoc, Python docstring, C# XML, etc.) and parses them via corresponding compilers/tools.

## Get up and running straight away

* Press `F5` to open a new window with your extension loaded.
* Run your command from the command palette by pressing (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P` on Mac) and typing `Hello World`.
* Set breakpoints in your code inside `src/extension.ts` to debug your extension.
* Find output from your extension in the debug console.

## Make changes

* You can relaunch the extension from the debug toolbar after changing code in `src/extension.ts`.
* You can also reload (`Ctrl+R` or `Cmd+R` on Mac) the VS Code window with your extension to load your changes.

## Explore the API

* You can open the full set of our API when you open the file `node_modules/@types/vscode/index.d.ts`.

## Run tests

* Install the [Extension Test Runner](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.extension-test-runner)
* Run the "watch" task via the **Tasks: Run Task** command. Make sure this is running, or tests might not be discovered.
* Open the Testing view from the activity bar and click the Run Test" button, or use the hotkey `Ctrl/Cmd + ; A`
* See the output of the test result in the Test Results view.
* Make changes to `src/test/extension.test.ts` or create new test files inside the `test` folder.
  * The provided test runner will only consider files matching the name pattern `**.test.ts`.
  * You can create folders inside the `test` folder to structure your tests any way you want.
